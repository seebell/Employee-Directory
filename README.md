## How it works

* Users are able to view all employees upon page load

* Users are able to search for an employee by name with the search bar at the top of the page

* Users can sort employees by last name in either ascending or descending order.


### User story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
